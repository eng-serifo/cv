                    Volk One is contract free, it's the future of shared internet networks.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">Have you ever imagined having a smartphone that allows access to the Internet, making
                    calls and send SMS without needing to be linked to any operator? This is the idea of
                    maker of the Volk One, a cell phone that uses long-range wireless hardware to
                    share Internet networks and create an independent mesh of connections.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Volk One: what is it?

                    The Volk One is an Android smartphone with premium cell phone features, developed by
                    Volkswagen Wireless company. The device delivers everything that a modern device offers, however,
                    has a very rare Internet connection technology, does not need a data plan or
                    contract with any operator to work.

                    The company was founded by Greg Hazel, formerly head of architecture at Bittorrent, and Straya
                    Markovic, former lead engineer for the Firechat mesh messaging platform. the two decided
                    use long-distance wireless transmitters to share and build a network of
                    cell phones.

                    The project seems quite bold and progressive, but does it have any chance of getting off the ground?
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Volk One: how does it work?

                    The Volk One comes with a Volk Fi router that can also be used as a charging base
                    wireless. It connects to the Internet via Wi-Fi or Ethernet cable and serves as an exit node for
                    devices on the Volk Fi network. According to its creators, the Volk Fi network is safe, without
                    censored and available to everyone.

                    In principle, a "4G" network is not created, but a mesh network, in which nodes can have certain
                    miles away, and as long as the latter is connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can get
                    free data, on a distributed network.

                    In a traditional mobile Internet network, offered by mobile operators, the
                    smartphone is connected to a cell phone antenna. With this, it is possible to access the Internet,
                    make calls and send text messages. However, the Volk One performs this process by
                    connect with another Volk One smartphone, which uses Volk Wireless technology.

                    By doing this, an independent Internet network is created, capable of offering the same
                    functionalities, ie access the Internet, make calls and send SMS. ok but how is it
                    possible?
                </p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3">

                <p></p>

                <p class="text-justify">The Volk Fi network is already in testing in San Francisco, California
                    The answer is simpler than you can imagine. Using a Wi-Fi hotspot, you will have access to
                    Internet, so someone else with the compatible device will use your signal and so on.
                    Therefore, the more people using it, the more powerful the connection mesh will be. like the
                    device comes with a Wi-Fi router, which has the same long-distance wireless transmission chip.
                    distance, Volk One smartphones will be able to connect to this device as well, generating a
                    Internet mesh network.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    And as you can see, it will take several devices in circulation to generate this
                    shared network. Also, internet speed will be limited to connection speed
                    Users' Wi-Fi, which can be excellent and, at the same time, very bad. Furthermore, as the
                    device specifications are not yet fully public, we do not know if they will leave
                    factory with support for Wi-Fi 6 or not. In case only Wi-Fi 5 is available now,
                    probably, those who choose to have a Volk One would have to change their cell phone and router for models
                    more modern in the very near future.

                    Another dilemma would be the range of network coverage. Despite the company's founders claiming
                    that Volk One devices may be a long way off, as they have “new hardware of
                    long-range radio that works with a smaller network of devices for optimal
                    coverage”, the mesh will depend on a significant number of smartphones and Volk routers
                    to deliver a good user experience. This is because many areas outside the cities will not have
                    a connection.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    Volk One: smartphone without operator link has a future?

                    Despite the super progressive project, it is clear that the company Volk Wireless will not only bet
                    on the Volk One's P2P connection. At this first moment, the devices have a slot for a card
                    SIM, which can be used in conjunction with the company's shared network technology.

                    However, the idea is extremely promising if we think on a large scale. Maybe the Volk One doesn't
                    must be a success so that the technology developed by the company gains more space. One
                    An example of this is the Android operating system itself, which has become the software for
                    most used mobile devices in the world without Google having to build their own
                    gadgets. Thus, Volk Wireless technology could be used, for example, by other
                    telephone operators or even large smartphone manufacturers.

                    Of course, there are many other issues surrounding the Volk One, especially regarding the
                    data usage from Wi-Fi networks or even in relation to the security of mesh members. However, that
                    must be answered as the project evolves.
