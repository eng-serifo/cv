                    Vulnerabilities in the 4G and 5G network allow attackers to intercept calls and track phone locations.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">A group of researchers discovered three new security vulnerabilities
                    in 4G and the 5G standard that allows attackers to intercept phone calls and identify
                    smartphone user locations, reports TechCrunch.

                    It is the first time that both 4G and the 5G standard are affected by these vulnerabilities. THE
                    4G and 5G network architecture is designed to provide faster speeds and better
                    security, especially against the use of mobile site simulators by authorities
                    police officers, known as "stingrays".

                    For those who don’t know, a stingray, also known as “cell site simulators” or
                    “IMSI catchers”, is a mobile surveillance device that mimics a wireless cell tower
                    and sends signals to trick all cell phones and other data devices
                    cell phones. automatically.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    However, the new attacks can overcome the latest protections that make it difficult to
                    spying on phone users.

                    "Anyone with a little knowledge of cellular paging protocols can perform
                    this attack," Syed Rafiul Hussain, one of the article's co-authors, told the TechCrunch email.

                    Hussain, along with Ninghui Li and Elisa Bertino of Purdue University, and Mitziu Echeverria and
                    Omar Chowdhury of the University of Iowa are expected to publicize their findings at the Symposium on
                    Network and Distributed Systems Security in San Diego on Tuesday.

                    The article titled “Privacy Attacks on 4G and 5G Cellular Paging Protocols Using
                    side channel information” talks about three types of attacks.
                </p>

                <p class="text-justify">
                    The first is the ToRPEDO (Tracking via Paging mEssage DistributiOn) attack, which exploits a
                    weakness of the 4G/5G paging protocol to allow an attacker to know the number of
                    victim's phone to verify the victim's presence in a specific cellular area and
                    identify the victim. pagination occasion.

                    The attacker could hijack the victim's paging channel, which would allow the attacker to
                    perform a denial-of-service attack by injecting fabricated, empty paging messages,
                    blocking the victim from receiving pending services (eg SMS) or emergency messages.
                    (eg amber alert).

                    ToRPEDO paves the way for two more attacks: Piercer, which exploits a vulnerability
                    deployment of the 4G paging protocol to allow an attacker to determine the number of
                    victim's phone with their IMSI (International Mobile Subscriber Identity), say the
                    researchers. In addition, ToRPEDO can also allow an attacker to mount an attack
                    Brute Force IMSI-Cracking that leaks the victim on 4G and 5G networks where the IMSI numbers are
                    encoded.

                    According to Hussain, even the newest 5G-capable devices are at risk of
                    stingrays with more advanced devices believed to be able to intercept calls and
                    text messages.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    All four major US carriers such as AT&T, Verizon (owner of
                    TechCrunch), Sprint and T-Mobile are affected by Torpedo, says Hussain. For example, a
                    successful ToRPEDO attack can be performed by installing sniffers costing as little as $200,
                    while a successful Piercer attack can be performed with a paging message sniffer
                    and a fake base station that costs around $400. In addition to the above, one more US network
                    it is also vulnerable to Piercer's attack, which was not named by Hussain.

                    Hussain says almost all cellular networks outside the US are vulnerable to attacks
                    ToRPEDO and Piercer, as they both exploit flaws in the 4G and 5G standards. Many of the European networks
                    and Asian women are very vulnerable to these attacks.

                    Researchers are not releasing proof-of-concept code to exploit the flaws
                    because of the nature of the attacks, Hussain said. The failures were reported to the GSMA, a body of the
                    sector representing mobile operators, who recognized the shortcomings, added
                    he.

                    According to Hussain, the GSMA first needs to fix the flaws in ToRPEDO and IMSI-Cracking,
                    while the Piercer fix depends only on the carriers. Since ToRPEDO is the precursor to
                    the other faults, should be fixed in priority, said Hussain.
